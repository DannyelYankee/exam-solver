# exam-solver

**exam-solver** is a backend-oriented project designed to simulate a real-world microservices architecture focused on exam correction automation. It showcases my experience in building distributed systems using Java, Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and OpenAI GPT-4 Vision.

## üîß Features

- The platform accepts exam submissions in PDF or image format and automatically processes them through a hybrid pipeline:
- PDFs are parsed using Apache PDFBox to extract text
- Images and scanned exams are preprocessed using Tesseract OCR
- If OCR fails, OpenAI GPT-4 Vision is used as a fallback
- Once the content is extracted, it's evaluated or completed by GPT based on the selected mode (`RESOLVE` or `CORRECT`)
- Gateway traffic is routed through NGINX to simulate load balancing and production-grade reverse proxy setup

## üß± Architecture

- Microservices: Gateway, Preprocessor, Integrator, OpenAI Service
- API access is routed through **NGINX**, which acts as a load balancer and reverse proxy to the Gateway
- The Gateway is implemented using **Spring Cloud Gateway**, providing routing, filtering, and basic API management
- Message-driven processing via RabbitMQ decouples the ingestion from the AI processing pipeline
- Retry mechanism with state transitions (`PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `FROZEN`, `FAILED`, `COMPLETED`)
- Results returned in `.txt` or `.zip` format

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **PostgreSQL**, **RabbitMQ**, **Tesseract OCR**, **Apache PDFBox**
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API (Text + Vision)**
- **NGINX** (as reverse proxy + load balancer)
- **Docker Compose** (multi-container orchestration)
- **OpenAPI / Swagger** (API docs)

## üöÄ Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Run `docker-compose up`
- NGINX exposes the system at: `http://localhost:80`
- API docs available at: `http://localhost/swagger-ui.html`
